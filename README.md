SQUAREWHEEL

Squarewheel aims to be a connection between the venue database of
foursquare and the nodes database of wheelmape (openstreetmap).

For example user should be able to check how foursquare venues are rated
for accessibility on foursquare or have the opportunity to rate places
they have been and checked in with foursquare.

The site is currently running on http://squarewheel.herokuapp.com/
